## What is Talon?

Talon is an open-source runtime for long-lived AI workflows. Connect a persona to the channels and tools you already use, choose its model provider and tool boundaries, and run it on infrastructure you control.

It is for operators who want more than another chat window: a personal or small-team assistant that can retain context, run scheduled work, and use explicitly configured integrations. Talon is self-hosted software, not a hosted AI service. External model providers and MCP servers receive only the data you choose to send to them.

### Why Talon?

- **Useful across your existing tools** — connect chat channels, schedules, skills, and MCP integrations around one assistant.
- **Runs where you choose** — deploy Talon yourself and select the model endpoint and integrations that fit your needs.
- **Built to keep working** — a durable queue, persistent threads, and background execution support work that outlives a single message.
- **Explicit boundaries** — personas receive only configured host-tool capabilities; host-side effects are audit logged.
- **Composable by design** — use one persona for one job or route work among specialised personas when the workflow warrants it.

## Quick start (Docker)

The fastest way to run Talon — no clone, no build, no toolchain. Download
the starter bundle, add your tokens, and bring it up:

```bash
# 1. Download and extract the starter bundle
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ivo-toby/talon/releases/latest/download/talon-starter.tar.gz | tar xz
cd talon-starter

# 2. Install the talonctl helper (no sudo)
./install.sh

# 3. Configure
cp .env.example .env                              # add your bot token + provider key
cp config/talond.example.yaml config/talond.yaml  # set allowedChatIds, pick a provider

# 4. Run
docker compose up -d
talonctl status
```

The daemon image is published to `ghcr.io/ivo-toby/talond` — multi-arch
(linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), `:latest` plus per-release tags. The compose
file pulls it for you; there is nothing to build.

**Guided setup with Claude Code.** The bundle ships a setup skill — run
`claude` in the extracted folder and type `/talon-setup-docker` to be
walked through provider choice, channel config, and first boot
conversationally.

Full bundle reference: [`starter/README.md`](starter/README.md). Prefer
running from a source clone as a systemd service? See
[Quick start (from source)](#quick-start-from-source).

### Is Talon a fit?

Talon is a good fit if you are comfortable operating self-hosted software and
want to connect AI to your own channels and services. It is not a consumer
assistant, a hosted SaaS, or a guarantee that an external model provider,
integration, or automation is safe without your configuration and review.

## Features

### Channels

- **Telegram** — Long polling with MarkdownV2 formatting
- **Slack** — Socket Mode with mrkdwn formatting
- **Terminal** — WebSocket server with `talonctl chat` client, rendered markdown output, persistent threads
- **Discord** — Gateway events with REST API, rate limit handling _(inbound not yet implemented)_
- **WhatsApp** — WhatsApp Web bridge via Baileys, supports dedicated number or self-chat mode
- **Email** — IMAP polling + SMTP send (imapflow / nodemailer), thread tracking via References / In-Reply-To headers _(IMAP polling verified against a live KPN mailbox; SMTP send not yet verified live)_

### Agent System

- **Persona-per-channel** — Each channel gets its own agent with a dedicated system prompt, model, tools, and capabilities
- **Provider-based execution** — Agents run through the configured provider runtime (Claude uses the Anthropic SDK path; Gemini and Codex use CLI strategies)
- **Per-thread memory** — Each conversation thread gets its own workspace with transcript, working memory, and artifacts
- **Skills** — Modular prompt and tool bundles with lazy loading (metadata-only in system prompt, full content on demand)
- **MCP integration** — Connect external MCP tool servers via stdio, HTTP, or SSE; Talon applies persona policy to its own host-tools bridge

### Provider choice

Choose the model runtime that fits your deployment. Talon keeps personas, channels, scheduling, and host-tool policy in its own layer while provider adapters execute the model call.

Under the hood, the provider layer separates the daemon from the model runtime, so changing or adding a provider does not require changes to the runner, queue, or context management. Each provider prepares an execution invocation, parses output, estimates context usage, and creates a runtime strategy. The daemon resolves providers separately for foreground and background agents.

The current provider matrix is deliberately implementation detail: Claude Code is the default; Gemini CLI and Codex CLI are supported; and the **experimental** Mastra-backed OpenAI-compatible provider can use Ollama, vLLM, Groq, and other compatible endpoints. Provider entries can set `type` to reuse an implementation under another name, such as `ollama-mac` alongside an Ollama Cloud entry.

This matters because it means you can:

- Run different providers for foreground vs background work (e.g., Claude for interactive, a local model for batch tasks)
- Add new providers without touching core pipeline code — implement the interface, register in config, done
- Configure provider-specific context windows and context-management policy per agent-runner provider
- Keep provider defaults simple while failing fast on removed legacy `context` config that now requires migration

          chat_template_kwargs:
            enable_thinking: false
```

### Infrastructure

- **Durable queue** — SQLite-backed message queue with crash recovery, retry, and dead-letter
- **Scheduler** — Agent-managed cron, interval, and one-shot scheduled tasks
- **Host-tools MCP bridge** — Built-in host tools (schedule, channel, memory, http, db, execution env, subagent, background agent) exposed via Unix socket
- **Sub-agent system** — Route mechanical LLM tasks (summarization, memory grooming, search) to API models or an existing Claude Code subscription via pluggable sub-agents
- **Background agents** — Launch long-running provider workers for deep tasks without blocking the foreground conversation
- **Sandboxed execution environments** — Isolate background agent work in persistent Firecracker VMs via [Sprites.dev](https://sprites.dev), with file transfer, checkpointing, and automatic cleanup
- **Hot reload** — Change config, personas, and skills without restarting the daemon
- **Systemd integration** — Watchdog heartbeat, graceful shutdown, timer-based wake-only mode
- **Session persistence** — Resumable agent sessions resume across messages in the same thread, scoped by provider, model, and configured reasoning effort so model or effort swaps start fresh
- **Provider-scoped context management** — Per-provider session rotation policy for latency or cost control, with compressed history injection into fresh sessions

### Observability (Langfuse)

- **Trace every agent run** — Each message-to-response cycle becomes a Langfuse trace with spans for agent execution, tool calls, and LLM generations
- **OpenTelemetry-native** — Built on the `@langfuse/otel` span processor and the standard `NodeTracerProvider`
- **No overhead when disabled** — A noop service replaces the real one; no Langfuse initialization or network traffic
- **Self-hosted or cloud** — Point `baseUrl` at your own Langfuse instance or use Langfuse Cloud

### Security

- **Default-deny capabilities** — Tools are gated by capability labels (`channel.send`, `schedule.manage`, etc.)
- **Scoped host-tool access** — Personas expose only the configured host tools
- **Secrets management** — Credentials via `${ENV_VAR}` substitution, never hardcoded in config
- **Audit logging** — Every side-effecting operation recorded with full provenance

---

## Architecture

Messages arrive from channels, pass through a durable queue, and get dispatched to the agent runner. The runner resolves a provider from the registry and executes via that provider's strategy (SDK streaming or CLI). Agents interact with the host through MCP host-tools on a Unix socket. Background agents run as separate provider-managed processes.

## Quick start (from source)

Run Talon from a clone — the path for native/systemd deployments and
local development. For the zero-build container path, see
[Quick start (Docker)](#quick-start-docker) above.

For the full deployment walkthrough, see the [setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md).

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+**
- **Claude Code** (default provider), and optionally **Gemini CLI** and/or **Codex CLI** installed and authenticated
- **SQLite** (ships with better-sqlite3, no separate install)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivo-toby/talon.git
cd talon
npm install
npm run build
```

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Run interactive setup — checks environment, creates directories, generates config
npx talonctl setup

# Add a Telegram channel
npx talonctl add-channel --name my-telegram --type telegram

# Add a persona (copies system.md from templates/ if available)
npx talonctl add-persona --name assistant

# Run database migrations
npx talonctl migrate

# Check everything is ready
npx talonctl doctor
```

### Start the Daemon

```bash
# Direct
node dist/index.js --config talond.yaml

# Or via npm
npm run talond
```

### Environment Variable Substitution

Credential fields support `${ENV_VAR}` syntax so you never hardcode secrets:

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-telegram
    type: telegram
    config:
      botToken: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
```

---

### Background Agent Workers

Talon includes a `background_agent` host tool for work that should keep running after the foreground turn returns. Typical examples are repo-wide refactors, large code searches, or longer research/coding tasks that should not block the active conversation.

This was added because Talon already had two extremes:

- the normal foreground agent turn, which is interactive and should stay responsive
- short synchronous sub-agents, which are useful for mechanical delegation but intentionally limited

Some tasks need the full provider CLI runtime and the persona's prompt + external MCP context, but they should still run out-of-band. Background agents fill that gap: the foreground agent starts a worker, gets a task ID immediately, and Talon tracks the worker to completion in SQLite.

The lifecycle is durable:

- Talon persists task state in the database
- the daemon enforces a concurrency limit
- completion, failure, timeout, and cancellation are recorded
- the originating thread gets a normal completion message through the existing queue and channel-send path

Background workers get a filtered version of Talon's host-tools MCP server based on the persona's capabilities. The `background_agent` tool is always excluded to prevent recursive spawning. When `sandbox=true`, the worker also gets the `execution_env` tool for running commands, transferring files, and checkpointing inside an isolated Sprite VM.

For sandboxed execution environments, see [Execution Environments (Sprites)](#execution-environments-sprites) below.

#### Configuration

```yaml
backgroundAgent:
  enabled: true
  maxConcurrent: 3
  defaultTimeoutMinutes: 30
  defaultProvider: claude-code
  providers:
    claude-code:
      enabled: true
      command: claude
      contextWindowTokens: 200000
    # Any of the other providers (gemini-cli, codex-cli, openai-compatible)
    # can be enabled here the same way they are in `agentRunner.providers`.
```

| Option                  | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`               | Globally enable or disable background workers                    |
| `maxConcurrent`         | Maximum number of background provider workers allowed at once    |
| `defaultTimeoutMinutes` | Default wall-clock timeout when a tool call does not provide one |
| `defaultProvider`       | Provider used for tasks that do not specify one explicitly       |
| `providers`             | Per-provider config; mirrors `agentRunner.providers`             |

##### Per-persona override

Personas can route their background agents through a different provider/model than their foreground runtime by setting `backgroundProvider` and (optionally) `backgroundModel`:

```yaml
personas:
  - name: assistant
    model: qwen3-coder:30b
    provider: openai-compatible # foreground stays on Ollama
    backgroundProvider: claude-code # background runs on Claude Code
    backgroundModel: claude-sonnet-4-6
  - name: work-context-manager
    model: qwen3-coder:30b
    provider: openai-compatible
    # no backgroundProvider — falls back to backgroundAgent.defaultProvider
```

`backgroundProvider` must be enabled under `backgroundAgent.providers`; the daemon refuses to start otherwise. `backgroundModel` is paired with `backgroundProvider` — setting it without `backgroundProvider` is rejected at config load. When a background run resolves its provider/model from persona configuration, Talon also forwards that persona's `reasoningEffort`; explicitly supplied background provider/model tool arguments do not inherit it.

Resolution order at spawn time:

1. Provider given explicitly in the `background_agent` tool call (strict)
2. Persona's `backgroundProvider`
3. Persona's foreground `provider` — **only** if it is also enabled in `backgroundAgent.providers`
4. `backgroundAgent.defaultProvider`

##### Using `openai-compatible` for background agents

`openai-compatible` (**experimental**) works as a background provider alongside the foreground `agentRunner` entry. Add it under `backgroundAgent.providers` the same way you would for the main agent:

```yaml
backgroundAgent:
  enabled: true
  maxConcurrent: 2
  defaultTimeoutMinutes: 30
  defaultProvider: openai-compatible # or keep claude-code and opt in per task
  providers:
    openai-compatible:
      enabled: true
      command: node # the bundled wrapper runs under node
      contextWindowTokens: 256000
      options:
        baseUrl: ${OLLAMA_BASE_URL} # e.g. https://ollama.com/v1
        defaultModel: ${OLLAMA_AGENT_MODEL}
        providerId: ollama # triggers auth.providers.ollama lookup
```

Notes:

- **Credentials are shared.** The background factory resolves them the same way the foreground one does — `auth.providers.<options.providerId>` first (e.g. `auth.providers.ollama`), falling back to `auth.providers.openai-compatible`. Nothing extra under `auth:` is needed if the agentRunner entry already works.
- **Background runs don't stream.** The wrapper still runs Mastra's streaming API internally, but only emits a terminal summary on stdout and writes the full response to a temp `last-message.txt` file. This bypasses the 100 KB stdout buffer cap, so long outputs are never truncated.
- **Tool calls still execute.** The background worker uses the same filtered host-tools MCP bridge as `claude-code`/`codex-cli` background workers; per-persona capabilities apply. Tool-call messages just aren't streamed to a channel because background runs don't have a live connection.
- **Per-task override.** If you'd rather keep `defaultProvider: claude-code` and only route specific tasks through `openai-compatible`, pass the provider explicitly when dispatching the background task (same mechanism as routing to `codex-cli`).

To let a persona use the feature, grant `subagent.background`:

```yaml
personas:
  - name: assistant
    capabilities:
      allow:
        - subagent.background
```

## Channel Connectors

Each connector implements the `ChannelConnector` interface: `start()`, `stop()`, `onMessage()`, `send()`, and `format()`. All connectors convert Markdown output to channel-native formatting automatically.

#### Common Channel Options

Every channel entry supports these optional top-level fields in addition to the connector-specific `config` block:

| Option          | Type    | Default | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`       | boolean | `true`  | Enable or disable the channel                                                 |
| `showToolCalls` | boolean | `false` | Send a human-readable message to the channel each time the agent calls a tool |

When `showToolCalls` is enabled, each tool invocation produces a short status message in the channel (e.g. _"🌐 Using Brave Search: query"_), giving users visibility into what the agent is doing behind the scenes.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-channel
    type: slack
    showToolCalls: true # sends a message like "🌐 Using Brave Search: web search" on each tool call
    config:
      botToken: ${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}
      appToken: ${SLACK_APP_TOKEN}
```

### Telegram

Long-polling connector using the Telegram Bot API.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-telegram
    type: telegram
    enabled: true
    config:
      botToken: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
      pollingTimeoutSec: 30
      allowedChatIds:
        - 123456789
```

- **Inbound**: Long polling via `getUpdates`
- **Outbound**: `sendMessage` with MarkdownV2 parse mode
- **Idempotency key**: `update_id`
- **Thread mapping**: `chat_id`

### Slack

Event-driven connector for Slack's Events API or Socket Mode.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-slack
    type: slack
    enabled: true
    config:
      botToken: ${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}
      appToken: ${SLACK_APP_TOKEN}
      signingSecret: ${SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET}
```

- **Inbound**: Events API webhooks or Socket Mode
- **Outbound**: `chat.postMessage` Web API
- **Idempotency key**: `event_id` > `client_msg_id` > `channel:ts`
- **Thread mapping**: `channel_id:thread_ts`
- **Format**: Slack mrkdwn (`*bold*`, `_italic_`, `` `code` ``)

### Discord

> **Not yet implemented**: The connector has send support and a `feedEvent()` ingestion method, but no Gateway WebSocket client to actually receive events from Discord. Needs a Gateway client similar to the Slack Socket Mode implementation. See TASK-043.

Push-based connector using the Discord Gateway and REST API.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-discord
    type: discord
    enabled: true
    config:
      botToken: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
      applicationId: '123456789'
      allowedChannelIds:
        - '987654321'
```

- **Inbound**: Gateway `MESSAGE_CREATE` events
- **Outbound**: REST API `POST /channels/{id}/messages`
- **Idempotency key**: Message snowflake ID
- **Thread mapping**: `channel_id:message_id`
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic retry with `Retry-After` header handling

### WhatsApp Business (Cloud API)

Meta Cloud API connector with an embedded webhook HTTP server for inbound events. Requires a Meta Business account with a WhatsApp-enabled phone number.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-whatsapp-business
    type: whatsappBusiness
    enabled: true
    config:
      phoneNumberId: '123456789'
      accessToken: ${WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN}
      verifyToken: ${WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN}
      appSecret: ${WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET} # enables inbound webhook server
      webhookPort: 3000 # default: 3000
      webhookHost: '0.0.0.0' # default: 0.0.0.0
      webhookPath: '/webhook' # default: /webhook
```

- **Inbound**: Embedded HTTP server handles Meta webhook verification (GET) and signed event delivery (POST with HMAC-SHA256 validation). Requires a public URL — use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) or ngrok for local dev.
- **Outbound**: REST API `POST /v21.0/{phoneNumberId}/messages`
- **Idempotency key**: WhatsApp message ID
- **Thread mapping**: Sender phone number

### WhatsApp Baileys

WhatsApp Web bridge using the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library. Connects as a regular WhatsApp Web client — no Meta Business account, no webhook server, no Cloud API.

> **Optional dependency**: `@whiskeysockets/baileys` is not bundled. Install it separately: `npm install @whiskeysockets/baileys`

Two usage modes: **dedicated number** (default) or **self-chat** (use your personal WhatsApp).

**Dedicated number** — a second WhatsApp account receives messages from others:

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-whatsapp
    type: whatsappBaileys
    enabled: true
    config:
      authDir: './baileys-auth'
      allowedSenders: # Restrict who can message the bot
        - '96490886312027'
```

**Self-chat** — the bot listens in your own "Message Yourself" thread. No second phone needed:

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-whatsapp
    type: whatsappBaileys
    enabled: true
    config:
      authDir: './baileys-auth'
      selfChat: true
      triggerWords: ['@Talon'] # Optional — filter by trigger word
```

#### Self-Chat Mode

Set `selfChat: true` to use your personal WhatsApp number. The bot only listens to messages you send in your own "Message Yourself" conversation (WhatsApp's built-in self-chat). All other conversations are ignored. No `allowedSenders` needed — only your own messages are processed.

#### Trigger Words

`triggerWords` filters messages so only those starting with a listed word are processed. The trigger word is stripped before the message reaches the agent — e.g. `@Talon what's the weather?` becomes `what's the weather?`. Case-insensitive.

Useful in self-chat mode (so not every note-to-self triggers the bot) or with a dedicated number in group-like scenarios. When omitted or empty, all messages pass through.

#### Access Control

For dedicated-number mode, use `allowedSenders` to restrict who can message the bot. When omitted or empty, all senders are accepted.

**Finding sender IDs:** WhatsApp uses opaque "LID" identifiers (e.g. `96490886312027@lid`) rather than phone numbers in many cases. You cannot predict which format a contact will use, so discover IDs from the logs:

1. Set `logLevel: debug` in `talond.yaml`
2. Start (or restart) talond
3. Send a test message from each phone that should be allowed
4. Find the log line `whatsapp-baileys: inbound message received` — the `jid` field shows the full identifier
5. Copy the part **before the `@`** (e.g. `96490886312027`) into `allowedSenders`
6. Set `logLevel` back to `info` and restart

#### Authentication

Baileys authenticates by scanning a QR code, like linking a new device in WhatsApp. Use the standalone CLI command to authenticate before starting the daemon:

```bash
# Authenticate — prints QR code, waits for scan, saves credentials
npx talonctl whatsapp-auth --auth-dir ./baileys-auth

# Custom timeout (default: 120s)
npx talonctl whatsapp-auth --auth-dir ./baileys-auth --timeout 180
```

Once authenticated, the daemon uses the saved credentials — no QR code display needed at runtime. To re-authenticate, delete the `authDir` folder and run the command again.

- **Access control**: Optional `allowedSenders` allowlist (dedicated-number mode) or `selfChat: true` (personal number)
- **Trigger words**: Optional `triggerWords` filter — trigger is stripped before reaching the agent
- **Inbound**: WhatsApp Web socket via Baileys, text messages from individual chats only (group and media messages logged and skipped in v1)
- **Outbound**: Send via Baileys socket using WhatsApp JID (e.g. `447700900000@s.whatsapp.net`)
- **Idempotency key**: Baileys message ID
- **Thread mapping**: Sender JID
- **Reconnection**: Automatic on disconnect; logged-out sessions require re-authentication (delete `authDir` and re-run `talonctl whatsapp-auth`)

### Email

> **Partly verified live**: IMAP polling (including the `ARC-Authentication-Results` / `requireDmarcPass` check) has been run against a live KPN mailbox. SMTP send is implemented and unit-tested but not yet verified against a live SMTP server. See TASK-049.

Dual-mode connector with IMAP polling and SMTP outbound.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-email
    type: email
    enabled: true
    config:
      imapHost: imap.gmail.com
      imapPort: 993
      imapUser: agent@example.com
      imapPass: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
      imapSecure: true
      smtpHost: smtp.gmail.com
      smtpPort: 587
      smtpUser: agent@example.com
      smtpPass: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
      smtpSecure: false
      fromAddress: 'Talon <agent@example.com>'
      # Optional
      allowedSenders:                  # see note below
        - 'alice@example.com'
      requireDmarcPass: true           # recommended when allowedSenders is set; needs trustedAuthServId
      trustedAuthServId: 'mx.kpnmail.nl'  # your provider's authserv-id (see below)
      pollingIntervalMs: 30000         # default 30000
      mailbox: 'INBOX'                 # default INBOX
```

- **Inbound**: IMAP polling of unseen messages (up to 20 per poll, oldest first; each message is marked `\Seen` after it parses). Webhook delivery via `feedInbound()` is also supported.
- **Outbound**: SMTP (nodemailer) with HTML formatting and a plain-text alternative
- **Idempotency key**: `Message-ID` header
- **Thread mapping**: the thread anchor is the root of the `References` chain (falling back to `In-Reply-To`, then `Message-ID`), so every reply in a conversation maps to one Talon thread. Replies carry the matching `Re:` subject and `In-Reply-To` / `References` headers.
- **Format**: Markdown to HTML conversion
- **`allowedSenders`**: matched against the `From` header, which is trivially forgeable. Use `requireDmarcPass: true` so inbound mail is only accepted when your mail provider reports `dmarc=pass` for the sender's domain. It defaults to `false`.
- **`requireDmarcPass`**: only works together with `trustedAuthServId`. Without it, every message is dropped (fail closed). The check reads `Authentication-Results` and `ARC-Authentication-Results` headers, but only values whose authserv-id equals `trustedAuthServId` are trusted; values from other hosts are ignored because a sender can forge them. The first trusted value must contain `dmarc=pass` and a `header.from=` matching the sender's domain.
- **`trustedAuthServId`**: the authserv-id your provider writes at the start of its `Authentication-Results` / `ARC-Authentication-Results` header. For KPN mail this is `mx.kpnmail.nl`. To find yours, open a received message's source (raw headers) from your mailbox and look at the first token after `i=1;` (or after the header name, if there is no `i=` tag) in the `ARC-Authentication-Results` or `Authentication-Results` line, for example `ARC-Authentication-Results: i=1; mx.kpnmail.nl; spf=pass ...`.
- **Size limit**: messages larger than 10 MiB are skipped and marked as read, so they are not retried.
- **Delivery caveat**: messages are marked as read in the mailbox before the agent handles them. If the daemon crashes in between, that one message is not processed.
- **`pollingIntervalMs`**: delay between IMAP polls (default 30 seconds). Errors back off exponentially up to 60 seconds.
- **`mailbox`**: IMAP folder to poll (default `INBOX`).

### Terminal

WebSocket-based connector for direct CLI access to any persona. Connect from any machine with `talonctl chat`.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: my-terminal
    type: terminal
    enabled: true
    config:
      port: 7700
      host: 0.0.0.0
      token: ${TERMINAL_TOKEN}
```

- **Inbound**: WebSocket JSON messages from `talonctl chat`
- **Outbound**: JSON response over WebSocket, client renders with `marked-terminal`
- **Auth**: Shared token with constant-time comparison, 64KB max payload, 10s auth timeout
- **Thread mapping**: `clientId` — same client always gets the same conversation thread
- **Persona override**: `--persona` flag switches persona at connect time
- **Format**: Raw markdown passthrough (client handles rendering)

#### Connecting

```bash
# Set token via env var or --token flag
export TERMINAL_TOKEN=your-secret-token

# Connect to a running Talon instance
talonctl chat --host 10.0.1.95 --port 7700 --persona assistant

# Or with explicit token
talonctl chat --host 10.0.1.95 --port 7700 --token your-secret-token

# Custom client ID for persistent thread identity
talonctl chat --host 10.0.1.95 --port 7700 --client-id my-laptop
```

The client provides:

- Rendered markdown output via `marked-terminal`
- Typing spinner (`ora`) while the agent works
- Persistent conversation — reconnecting with the same `clientId` resumes the thread
- Graceful disconnect on Ctrl+C

---

## Multi-Connector Setup

You can run N connector instances of the same channel type — for example, multiple Slack bots — each with its own credentials and default persona binding. Channels are identified by `name` (unique), not by `type`.

### Use cases

- **Virtual team** — deploy per-persona bots in a single Slack workspace: PM-bot, Dev-bot, Content-bot, each responding in character.
- **Per-persona Telegram bots** — multiple bots in a shared group, each bound to a different persona.

### Configuration

Add multiple entries of the same `type` under `channels:`, give each a unique `name`, and create a `bindings:` entry for each:

```yaml
channels:
  - name: slack-pm
    type: slack
    enabled: true
    config:
      botToken: ${SLACK_PM_BOT_TOKEN}
      appToken: ${SLACK_PM_APP_TOKEN}
      signingSecret: ${SLACK_PM_SIGNING_SECRET}

  - name: slack-dev
    type: slack
    enabled: true
    config:
      botToken: ${SLACK_DEV_BOT_TOKEN}
      appToken: ${SLACK_DEV_APP_TOKEN}
      signingSecret: ${SLACK_DEV_SIGNING_SECRET}

bindings:
  - persona: product-manager
    channel: slack-pm
    isDefault: true
  - persona: developer
    channel: slack-dev
    isDefault: true
```

### Bot-self filtering

Connectors automatically filter inbound messages from all bot accounts to prevent feedback loops — no configuration needed:

- **Slack** — drops all messages with a `bot_id` field.
- **Discord** — drops all messages from `author.bot` accounts.
- **Telegram** — drops all messages where `from.is_bot` is true.
- **WhatsApp Baileys** — filters via JID-based self-detection.

WhatsApp Business (Cloud API) does not implement bot-self filtering; avoid running multiple Talon bots that share the same WhatsApp Business account.

### Channel routing

The `channel_send` tool routes by channel `name`, so a persona bound to `slack-pm` posts through the PM bot identity and a persona bound to `slack-dev` posts through the Dev bot identity.

### WhatsApp note

If you run multiple WhatsApp Business connectors with inbound webhooks, each must use a unique `webhookPort`.

---

## Personas

A persona defines an AI agent's identity, capabilities, and channel bindings. Bindings are managed separately via `talonctl bind`.

```yaml
personas:
  - name: alfred
    description: Personal assistant
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    provider: claude-code
    # Optional for Codex CLI and OpenAI-compatible Responses personas.
    # OpenAI Responses: none, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max, ultra.
    # Codex CLI: minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max, ultra.
    # reasoningEffort: medium
    systemPromptFile: personas/alfred/system.md
    skills:
      - web-search
      - calendar
    capabilities:
      allow:
        - channel.send:telegram
        - channel.send:slack
        - net.http
        - schedule.manage
        - memory.access
        - db.query:own

bindings:
  - persona: alfred
    channel: my-telegram
    isDefault: true
  - persona: alfred
    channel: my-slack
    isDefault: true
```

`reasoningEffort` is a persona-level knob for Codex CLI and OpenAI-compatible Responses providers. Talon rejects it at config load for unsupported providers, values unsupported by the persona's provider, and OpenAI-compatible chat-completions mode. Codex CLI accepts `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra`; omit the field to use the provider default because Codex CLI does not support `none`. OpenAI-compatible Responses additionally accepts `none`. Use the base model name in `model`; Talon does not support model-name suffix aliases for effort levels.

### Persona templates

Default system prompt templates live in `templates/<name>/system.md` and are safe to commit. The `personas/` directory is gitignored — personal prompts stay local.

When creating a persona, `add-persona` checks `templates/<name>/system.md` first. If a named template exists it is copied to `personas/<name>/system.md`; otherwise a generic starter prompt is generated. Existing files are never overwritten — your customisations are safe.

### Capability Labels

Tools are gated by scoped capability labels. Anything not listed in a persona's
capability configuration is denied by default. Today, tools listed in either
`allow` or `requireApproval` are exposed to the provider runtime. The latter
field is reserved for bridge-level approval enforcement; it does not currently
prompt a user or block execution.

| Capability               | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channel.send:<channel>` | Send messages to a specific channel                                         |
| `persona.send:*`         | Delegate to another persona, list personas, and fetch delegated task status |
| `schedule.manage`        | Create/modify/delete scheduled tasks                                        |
| `memory.access`          | Read/write per-thread structured memory                                     |
| `net.http`               | Fetch external URLs                                                         |
| `db.query`               | Execute read-only database queries                                          |
| `subagent.invoke`        | Invoke sub-agents for delegated tasks                                       |
| `subagent.background`    | Launch and manage background workers                                        |
| `execution.env`          | Manage sandboxed Sprite execution environments                              |

### Capability Resolution

When an agent requests a tool:

```mermaid

    A[Tool request] --> B{In persona's<br/>capability configuration?}
    B -->|not listed| C[Reject]
    B -->|allow or requireApproval| D[Expose tool to provider runtime]
```

---

## Skills

Skills are modular bundles of prompts, tools, and configuration that snap onto personas. Skills use **lazy loading** — only metadata (name + description) is injected into the system prompt. Full instructions are loaded on demand when the agent calls the `skill_load` tool.

### Skill Formats

Two on-disk formats are supported:

**SKILL.md** (recommended) — single file with YAML frontmatter:

```
skills/<skill_name>/
  SKILL.md             # YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
  mcp/*.json           # MCP server definitions (optional)
  tools/*.yaml         # tool manifests (optional)
  migrations/*.sql     # DB migrations (optional)
```

**skill.yaml + prompts/** (legacy) — separate manifest and prompt files:

```
skills/<skill_name>/
  skill.yaml           # metadata, required capabilities
  prompts/*.md         # prompt instruction fragments
  mcp/*.json           # MCP server definitions (optional)
  tools/*.yaml         # tool manifests (optional)
  migrations/*.sql     # DB migrations (optional)
```

### Adding a Skill

```bash
# SKILL.md format (recommended)
npx talonctl add-skill --name web-search --persona assistant --format skillmd

# Legacy YAML format
npx talonctl add-skill --name web-search --persona assistant
```

### Lazy Loading

Only skill name and description are included in the agent's system prompt per run. When the agent needs a skill's full instructions, it calls `skill_load`. MCP servers from skills still connect eagerly at startup.

| Scenario           | Eager (old) | Lazy (current) |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 7 skills, using 1  | ~21k tokens | ~3.7k tokens   |
| 20 skills, using 0 | ~60k tokens | ~2k tokens     |

Background agents use eager loading to ensure full access without calling `skill_load`.

#### Per-skill eager opt-in

Some skills describe reflexive behaviors (e.g. "search memory before answering") that smaller models miss when only the description is available. Mark such a skill `eager: true` in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter (or `skill.yaml`) and its full body is merged into the persona system prompt at startup — the rest of the persona's skills stay lazy.

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when …
eager: true
---
```

Defaults to `false`. Useful when a persona runs on a model that doesn't reliably autonomously call `skill_load` for indirect triggers (most open-weight ≤70B-effective models).

The Talon + Postgram starter stack includes an eager `postgram-memory` skill. Its search guidance treats compact Postgram hits as matched chunks: before answering factual status, policy, completion, or verification questions from memory, the agent recalls the relevant full entities by ID and reports when the answer cannot be confirmed. See [`starter-stack/README.md`](starter-stack/README.md#how-the-agent-uses-postgram).

### Skill Resolution

Persona capabilities and skill requirements are intersected at runtime:

```
granted = persona.capabilities ∩ skill.requiredCapabilities
```

Skills with unmet capabilities produce a warning at startup and are skipped.

### HTTP MCP Servers and OAuth

For HTTP / SSE MCP servers that require OAuth (e.g. Glean, GitHub Enterprise),
Talon owns the token lifecycle directly — no `mcp-remote` or other stdio
bridge process at runtime. The auth flow supports Dynamic Client Registration
or a pre-registered OAuth client whose credentials are referenced from the
daemon environment.

The interactive OAuth dance lives in `talonctl auth-mcp`, runs once per
server, and writes a refreshable token bundle into Talon's data dir. The
daemon reads + refreshes that bundle on every agent run and injects the
resulting `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header into the MCP server config
before the provider sees it. Providers never receive the OAuth cache or client
credentials; Talon applies a native-tool restriction for runs that use an
OAuth-authenticated MCP server.

**Add an OAuth-protected server:**

```bash
talonctl add-mcp --skill work-search --name glean --transport http \
  --url https://search.example.com/mcp --auth oauth2
```

By default, `talonctl auth-mcp` uses Dynamic Client Registration when the
authorization server advertises it. For a pre-registered client, set the
client credential variable names (not their values) when adding the server:

```bash
talonctl add-mcp --skill work-search --name enterprise-search --transport http \
  --url https://search.example.com/mcp --auth oauth2 \
  --scopes search:read \
  --client-id-env SEARCH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID \
  --authorization-server-issuer https://identity.example.com \
  --client-secret-env SEARCH_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_basic
```

`client_secret_post` is also supported. With a client secret, the default is
`client_secret_basic`; if no secret is needed, omit `--client-secret-env` and
the client defaults to the public `none` method. Put
the actual values in `.env`, which Docker Compose injects into the daemon.
Talon requests no OAuth scopes by default; use `--scopes <scope...>` to ask
only for the scopes this persona needs, rather than automatically requesting
every scope advertised by the provider.
Register `http://127.0.0.1:8788/callback` as an allowed redirect URI for a
pre-registered client (and use the matching port if you change it).
If the MCP resource URL or configured scopes change, rerun `auth-mcp`; Talon
rejects a cached token bundle whose authorization context no longer matches.
Talon expands `${ENV_VAR}` references in MCP headers and stdio environment
values once. If the resulting value still contains provider-expandable
environment syntax (for example `$VAR` or `${VAR}`), Talon fails closed before
provider startup because some provider CLIs expand those references in their
MCP configuration.

For an MCP server using a static API token instead, use an environment
placeholder in an HTTP header or stdio environment value. Quote the argument
so your shell does not expand it before Talon writes the skill definition:

```bash
talonctl add-mcp --skill work-search --name internal-search --transport http \
  --url https://search.example.com/mcp \
  --headers 'Authorization=Bearer ${SEARCH_API_TOKEN}'
```

`talonctl env-check` reports missing variables referenced by `talond.yaml` and
by MCP server definitions under `skills/*/mcp/*.json`. It reports names and
status only, never values.

**Skill config shape:**

```json
{
  "name": "glean",
  "config": {
    "name": "glean",
    "transport": "http",
    "url": "https://contentful-be.glean.com/mcp/default",
  "auth": {
    "kind": "oauth2",
    "clientIdEnv": "SEARCH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecretEnv": "SEARCH_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "authorizationServerIssuer": "https://identity.example.com",
    "tokenEndpointAuthMethod": "client_secret_basic"
    }
  }
}
```

The skill loader stamps `auth.tokenStore: "<skillName>/<serverName>"` when
omitted. Token bundles live at `<dataDir>/mcp-auth/<tokenStore>.json` (mode
0600, atomic temp+rename writes).

**One-time authorisation:**

```bash
# Native install (operator's desktop — opens local browser)
talonctl auth-mcp work-search:glean

# Docker starter on the same desktop: open the printed URL in the host browser
talonctl auth-mcp work-search:glean --docker

# Remote native daemon (operator connects over SSH)
talonctl auth-mcp work-search:glean --headless
# Prints the auth URL plus an `ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> server`
# command. Run the SSH forward from your local machine, then open the URL
# in your local browser — the callback comes back over the forward.
```

The Docker starter publishes the callback on host loopback only
(`127.0.0.1:8788`). `--docker` listens on the container interface only while
the one-time authorization command is running; it does not expose the callback
to the LAN. If you change `--port`, change the Compose port mapping to match.

OAuth MCP resource URLs must use HTTPS. The command performs Dynamic Client
Registration (RFC 7591) when configured without a client id, generates a PKCE
challenge, runs the standard authorisation-code flow, and persists the
resulting access + refresh tokens.
For pre-registered clients, `authorizationServerIssuer` is required and pins
metadata discovery to the configured HTTPS issuer; pre-registered credentials
use environment-variable references and the client secret is not copied into
the token bundle. DCR-issued token
bundles are stored under `<dataDir>/mcp-auth/` with mode `0600`; the daemon
picks up a new bundle on the next agent run, with no restart required.

When a persona uses an OAuth-authenticated HTTP/SSE MCP server, Talon disables
the provider's native shell and filesystem tools. Provider web search/fetch,
Talon's capability-gated host tools, and configured MCP servers remain
available. Codex CLI cannot disable its native tools, so those runs fail closed
with a provider-switch message. This limits model-visible tool access; it is
not OS-level isolation from another process running as the daemon's Unix user.

**Refresh:** the daemon automatically refreshes access tokens that fall
within 60 s of expiry, using the cached `refresh_token` and the OAuth
provider's `token_endpoint`. If both access and refresh have expired,
agent runs fail loudly with a "re-run `talonctl auth-mcp`" message.

## Sub-Agents

### Why Sub-Agents?

The main agent (Claude Sonnet) is powerful but expensive. Many tasks it performs are mechanical — searching files, retrieving memories, grooming stale data, summarizing transcripts. These don't need Sonnet-level reasoning; a cheaper model like Haiku can handle them in a fraction of the cost and time.

Sub-agents solve this by offloading specific, well-scoped tasks to cheap models. The main agent stays focused on conversation and decision-making, while sub-agents handle the grunt work and return structured results. This keeps per-message costs low without sacrificing capability.

### How Sub-Agents Work

1. The main agent calls `subagent_invoke` via MCP, specifying a sub-agent name and input
2. The daemon validates that the persona is assigned this sub-agent and has the required capabilities
3. The **ModelResolver** creates an AI SDK model instance for the configured API provider or an isolated direct CLI adapter for an enabled subscription provider
4. The sub-agent's `run()` function executes with a system prompt, model, and injected services
5. Results flow back to the main agent as structured data

### Model Overrides and Failover

By default, each sub-agent uses the model declared in its `subagent.yaml` manifest. Operators can override this in `talond.yaml` without editing manifests, and configure an ordered failover chain so if the primary model is unavailable, the next is tried automatically.

```yaml
subagents:
  memory-groomer:
    model:
      - provider: ollama
        name: qwen3-30b
        # maxTokens: 4096     # optional — falls back to subagent.yaml default
        # timeoutMs: 120000   # optional per-model wall-clock timeout (min 1000)
      - provider: anthropic
        name: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  session-summarizer:
    model:
      - provider: openai
        name: gpt-5.4-spark
```

**Per-model fields:**

| Field             | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider`        | Provider slot: `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `ollama`, `claude-code`, or `codex-sandbox` (required)                    |
| `name`            | Model name as the provider expects it (required)                                                                         |
| `maxTokens`       | Max output tokens; falls back to the manifest value. Advisory for subscription-backed adapters                          |
| `timeoutMs`       | Per-model wall-clock timeout. On expiry the runner aborts the in-flight AI SDK call and fails over to the next model     |
| `providerOptions` | Free-form record forwarded to the AI SDK call. Use this for vendor-specific knobs (see `providerOptions` below)         |

`anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, and `ollama` are AI SDK provider slots.
`claude-code` is a direct, subscription-authenticated adapter available only to
sub-agents after explicit opt-in under `subagentCli`. `codex-sandbox` is a
subscription-authenticated adapter that calls a separately deployed Codex
runner under `subagentSandbox`; neither uses the foreground/background
`AgentProvider` registry. `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`, and `openai-compatible`
are not sub-agent model providers; use `ollama` for OpenAI-compatible
sub-agent endpoints. Direct Codex CLI remains deliberately excluded because its
agentic execution mode cannot enforce Talon's filesystem-read boundary.

#### Subscription-backed sub-agents

Use this for small, bounded sub-agent tasks when the daemon's OS user is already
logged into Claude Code, or when a separately contained runner is logged into a
dedicated Codex/ChatGPT account. Neither path uses `auth.providers` or an API
key. The Claude child receives an explicit environment allowlist containing its
normal Claude login paths and, for headless setups, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
API-key and alternate API-routing environment variables are excluded before it
starts.

```yaml
subagentCli:
  claudeCode:
    enabled: true
    command: claude # optional path or command name

subagentSandbox:
  codex:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: http://codex-runner:9700 # use http://127.0.0.1:9700 for a native daemon
    token: ${TALON_CODEX_RUNNER_TOKEN}
    startupTimeoutMs: 30000 # wait for the supervised runner before accepting work

subagents:
  session-summarizer:
    model:
      - provider: claude-code
        name: claude-sonnet-4-6
        timeoutMs: 60000
      - provider: codex-sandbox
        name: gpt-5.6-terra
        timeoutMs: 60000
      - provider: anthropic # ordinary API fallback, if configured
        name: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

Each attempt is a single isolated generation, not an agent run: no Talon host
tools, MCP servers, provider sessions, or persona tool access are exposed.
Claude Code runs in safe mode with tools disabled and no session persistence.
The configured `timeoutMs` aborts the whole CLI process group, waits briefly
for cleanup, and then fails over. Claude Code does not provide a hard
`maxTokens` limit. Codex uses a fresh App Server process, ephemeral thread, and
empty temporary home/workspace per attempt. System instructions are passed in
the App Server's trusted developer-instruction field, while the task remains a
user message. It starts only with ChatGPT authentication; API-key and gateway
authentication fail closed. The runner has no Talon host-tools bridge, MCP
configuration, persona data, host mounts, or Docker socket. Any built-in Codex
tool activity is interrupted and returned as a failed attempt, so the next
model can take over.

##### Codex runner deployment

The runner is an optional, externally supervised sidecar, not a process inside
`talond`. It is the required containment boundary on Linux and macOS (via
Docker Desktop's Linux VM). Use a dedicated Codex/ChatGPT account: its runner
login remains sensitive subscription state even though it is never exposed to
Talon. When enabled, `talond` waits for the runner's authenticated `/readyz`
endpoint before it starts channels, scheduling, or queue processing. It never
starts Docker or Podman itself: granting the daemon container-runtime authority
would defeat this containment boundary.

For the Docker starter, add a random `TALON_CODEX_RUNNER_TOKEN` (at least 32
characters) to `.env`, then start the optional profile and authenticate inside
the isolated runner volume:

```bash
docker compose --profile codex-sandbox up -d
docker compose exec -e CODEX_HOME=/auth -it codex-runner codex login
docker compose exec -e CODEX_HOME=/auth codex-runner codex login status
```

This is a one-time deployment and login step. The Compose service uses
`restart: unless-stopped`, so Docker restarts it automatically after host
reboots; do **not** run `node dist/codex-runner/index.js` on the Talon host.
The Compose service has no host port, no Talon volume, and no Docker socket.

For a native Linux daemon managed by systemd, install the runner dependency
alongside Talon. The runner remains a separate Docker container and systemd
starts it before `talond` on every boot:

```bash
sudo ./deploy/install-service.sh --user talon --dir /home/talon/talon --codex-runner
sudo systemctl start talon-codex-runner
sudo docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yaml -f deploy/docker-compose.native-runner.yaml \
  --profile codex-sandbox exec -e CODEX_HOME=/auth codex-runner codex login
sudo systemctl start talond
```

Use `endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:9700` for that native setup. The interactive
login is the only manual runner action; its Docker service and `talond` then
start together after reboots. On macOS, create the same runner once with Docker
or rootless Podman and `--restart unless-stopped`; configure Docker Desktop (or
your container runtime) to start at login. The runner is published only on
loopback for a native daemon:

```bash
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile.codex-runner -t talon-codex-runner .
docker volume create talon-codex-runner-auth
docker run --rm -it -v talon-codex-runner-auth:/auth -e CODEX_HOME=/auth \
  --entrypoint codex talon-codex-runner login
docker run -d --name talon-codex-runner --restart unless-stopped \
  --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=256m \
  --cap-drop ALL --cap-add SETUID --cap-add SETGID --security-opt no-new-privileges:true \
  -p 127.0.0.1:9700:9700 -v talon-codex-runner-auth:/auth \
  -e TALON_CODEX_RUNNER_TOKEN="$TALON_CODEX_RUNNER_TOKEN" talon-codex-runner
```

Authenticate Claude Code interactively as the same OS user that runs `talond`
before enabling it. Restart the daemon after changing `subagentCli`,
`subagentSandbox`, or a sub-agent model chain; hot reload does not rebuild the
resolver and bound sub-agent runners. Plan/quota consumption and any
subscription price are external to Talon, so sub-agent results may include token
counts where the CLI supplies them but never invent a `costUsd` value.
Authentication, quota, runner, or CLI failures are normal failover failures and
try the next entry in the chain.

**How failover works:**

1. The runner tries each model in the `model` array in order
2. If a model fails (missing credentials, provider down, runtime error), it logs a warning and tries the next
3. On timeout, the runner aborts the in-flight call via `AbortController` and fails over — timeouts are not terminal
4. After exhausting the override list, the manifest's `model` is tried as a final fallback
5. If all models fail, the error includes a summary of each attempt and why it failed

Overrides apply everywhere a sub-agent runs, including the context roller's summarizer path. Each attempt gets its own `timeoutMs` and `providerOptions` — settings do not leak across chain entries. `providerOptions` is ignored for subscription-backed entries.

Sub-agents with no entry in `subagents:` use their manifest model unchanged. All per-model fields except `provider` and `name` are optional.

#### `providerOptions` — vendor knob passthrough

`providerOptions` is a free-form record of fields forwarded verbatim to the AI SDK call (`generateText` / `generateObject`). Use it to pass vendor-specific knobs like sampling parameters or custom chat template arguments.

**Effective only on the `ollama` slot.** The `ollama` provider is Talon's OpenAI-compatible passthrough entry point — point it at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (real Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, a Cloudflare-tunneled node) via `auth.providers.ollama.baseURL`. Typed providers (`anthropic`, `openai`, `google`) and subscription CLI providers silently drop unknown fields, so keep `providerOptions` on the `ollama` entry of your chain.

**Example — route `session-summarizer` to Qwen3 on llama.cpp with thinking mode disabled, fall back to Claude:**

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    ollama:
      baseURL: http://localhost:8080/v1 # llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible endpoint

subagents:
  session-summarizer:
    model:
      - provider: ollama
        name: Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL
        timeoutMs: 180000
        maxTokens: 32768
        providerOptions:
          chat_template_kwargs:
            enable_thinking: false
      - provider: anthropic
        name: claude-sonnet-4-6
        timeoutMs: 60000
        # no providerOptions on the fallback — Claude would drop them anyway
```

The runner wraps `providerOptions` under the active model entry's provider name internally (the user-facing YAML shape is flat). On failover to the Anthropic entry, `providerOptions` is not carried over — the Qwen-specific `chat_template_kwargs` never reaches Claude.

**Built-in sub-agent names** (use these as keys under `subagents:` in `talond.yaml`):

| Name                 | Default model               | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file-searcher`      | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Search files by content, return ranked results with snippets  |
| `memory-retriever`   | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Find relevant memories via keyword pre-filter + LLM rerank    |
| `memory-groomer`     | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Prune stale, consolidate duplicate memory items               |
| `session-summarizer` | `claude-sonnet-4-6`         | Compress transcripts for rolling context window (legacy)      |
| `session-observer`   | `claude-sonnet-4-6`         | Generate dated, prioritized observations for long-term memory |
| `session-reflector`  | `claude-sonnet-4-6`         | Consolidate observations when log grows too large             |
| `spark-coder`        | `gpt-5.4-spark`             | Fast single-shot code generation (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)  |

Sub-agents are loaded from three locations at startup (later overrides earlier):

1. **Built-in** (`dist/subagents/default/`) — ships with the daemon
2. **Project-level** (`cwd()/subagents/`) — custom agents in the project directory
3. **Data directory** (`dataDir/subagents/`) — deployment-specific agents

### Sub-Agent Structure

```
src/subagents/default/<agent_name>/    # built-in agents (compiled with daemon)
  subagent.yaml          # manifest: model, capabilities, timeout
  index.ts               # entry point: run(ctx, input) -> Result<SubAgentResult>
  prompts/*.md           # system prompt fragments (concatenated in order)
  lib/                   # optional helper modules
```

### Authoring Custom Sub-Agents

The `run(ctx, input)` function receives a `SubAgentContext` from the runner. A custom sub-agent **must** forward the following context fields to any Vercel AI SDK `generateText` / `generateObject` call it makes:

```typescript
import { generateText } from 'ai';

export async function run(ctx, input) {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: ctx.model,
    system: ctx.systemPrompt,
    prompt: '...',
    maxOutputTokens: ctx.maxOutputTokens,
    experimental_telemetry: ctx.telemetry,
    abortSignal: ctx.abortSignal, // REQUIRED — see below
    providerOptions: ctx.providerOptions, // REQUIRED — for ollama passthrough
  });
  // ...
}
```

**`ctx.abortSignal` is a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have.** The runner creates an `AbortController` per model attempt and aborts it when the per-model `timeoutMs` fires. Sub-agents that do not forward `ctx.abortSignal` to their in-flight LLM calls will:

1. Keep consuming the upstream provider's resources (tokens, rate limit quota, compute) after the runner has given up on that model
2. Keep running in the background while failover already advances to the next model — producing overlapping, orphaned work
3. Resolve later with a result that nothing is listening for, masking incidents

All five built-in sub-agents forward both fields. Copy the pattern above when authoring new ones.

**`ctx.providerOptions`** is only non-undefined when the active model entry is on the `ollama` provider slot (Talon's OpenAI-compatible passthrough). The runner wraps the user's override record under the provider name, and typed providers (`anthropic`, `openai`, `google`) receive `undefined` so they never see foreign body fields.

### Built-in Sub-Agents

#### `file-searcher`

**Problem:** The main agent has no filesystem access outside its sandbox. When a user asks "find my notes about deployment," the agent would need to read every file itself — slow, expensive, and context-heavy.

**Solution:** Uses a cascading search backend (`rg` → `grep` → Node.js `readdir`/`readFile`) to find matches by content, then optionally ranks results with an LLM when there are too many hits. Returns ranked file paths with relevant snippets.

|                           |                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**                 | Haiku 4.5                                                                 |
| **Required capabilities** | `fs.read:*`                                                               |
| **Timeout**               | 30s                                                                       |
| **Input**                 | `{ query, rootPaths?, extensions?, maxFileSize?, maxResultsWithoutLlm? }` |
| **Output**                | Ranked list of `{ path, snippet, relevance }`                             |

The search cascade tries `rg --json` first (fastest, with `--ignore-case`, `--max-filesize`, context lines), falls back to `grep -rni` if rg isn't installed, and finally to a pure Node.js implementation as a last resort. If fewer than 20 matches are found, they're returned directly without LLM ranking.

#### `memory-retriever`

**Problem:** As threads accumulate memory items (facts, summaries, notes), finding the right ones for context becomes a search problem. Loading all memories into the main agent's context is wasteful when only a few are relevant.

**Solution:** Reads all memory items for the current thread, applies a keyword pre-filter, then uses an LLM to rank the remaining candidates by relevance to the query. Returns the top-K results with relevance scores and reasoning.

|                           |                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**                 | Haiku 4.5                                                 |
| **Required capabilities** | `memory.access:*`                                         |
| **Timeout**               | 30s                                                       |
| **Input**                 | `{ query, topK?, threshold? }`                            |
| **Output**                | Ranked list of `{ id, type, content, relevance, reason }` |

If fewer than 10 keyword matches are found, they're returned directly without LLM ranking. The LLM filters out items with relevance below 0.3.

#### `memory-groomer`

**Problem:** Memory items accumulate over time — duplicates, outdated facts, superseded summaries. Without grooming, context assembly pulls in stale data that confuses the main agent.

**Solution:** Reads memory items for the current thread (optionally filtered by time window), sends them to an LLM that classifies each as `prune` (delete), `consolidate` (merge duplicates into one), or `keep`. Executes the recommended actions against the database. Consolidation inserts the merged entry before deleting sources to prevent data loss.

|                           |                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**                 | Haiku 4.5                                                       |
| **Required capabilities** | `memory.access:*`                                               |
| **Timeout**               | 30s                                                             |
| **Input**                 | `{ periodMs?, protectedKeyPrefixes? }` (optional: only groom items from the last N ms; skip keys starting with any given prefix) |
| **Output**                | `{ pruned, consolidated, kept }` counts                         |

Uses `generateObject` with a Zod discriminated union schema to ensure the LLM returns valid, typed actions.

**Protected keys:** pass `protectedKeyPrefixes` (e.g. `["mail:", "calendar:"]`) to exclude operational-state keys owned by other tasks (last-checked timestamps, dedup lists). Matching memory items (item id = `memory_access` key) are removed before the model sees the list and can never be pruned or consolidated; the summary reports how many were skipped.

#### `session-summarizer`

**Problem:** Long conversations consume context window space. When the agent resumes a thread, it needs the key facts without replaying the entire transcript.

**Solution:** Takes a raw conversation transcript and compresses it into a structured summary using `generateObject` with a Zod schema. Returns key facts (important decisions and information), open threads (unresolved topics), and a narrative summary.

|                           |                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**                 | Haiku 4.5                                                        |
| **Required capabilities** | none                                                             |
| **Timeout**               | 30s                                                              |
| **Input**                 | `{ transcript }`                                                 |
| **Output**                | `{ keyFacts: string[], openThreads: string[], summary: string }` |

This sub-agent is called automatically by the **rolling context window** (see below) — it is not invoked manually by the agent.

#### `spark-coder`

**Problem:** Code generation tasks inside agentic loops are bottlenecked by the main model's speed. The parent agent already knows what code to generate — it just needs a fast model to produce it.

**Solution:** Uses OpenAI's `gpt-5.3-spark` for fast, single-shot code generation. Receives a task description, optional context files, and optional constraints, then returns structured file operations (create or replace) via `generateObject` with a Zod schema. The parent agent handles all filesystem I/O; this sub-agent is pure generation with no tool use or agentic loop.

| **Required capabilities** | none                                                  |
| **Requires env**          | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                                      |
| **Timeout**               | 60s                                                   |

| **Output**                | `{ files: [{ path, content, action }], explanation }` |

This sub-agent is only loaded when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment. Pairs well with the `execution_env` host tool for a generate → test → fix loop where the parent agent orchestrates between spark-coder (fast generation) and Sprites (sandboxed execution).

### Rolling Context Window

Long conversations eventually fill a provider's context window. Talon monitors provider-specific context metrics after each agent run and automatically rotates the session when the configured threshold is exceeded, keeping conversations seamless without jarring resets. For Claude latency optimization, `cache_total_input_tokens` is the strongest signal because it tracks the total cached session footprint after the run. For Codex, `cache_read_input_tokens` is the best latency-oriented signal because the CLI reports cached prompt reuse as `cached_input_tokens`, which Talon normalizes into `cache_read_input_tokens`.

**How it works:**

```
Agent run completes → selected trigger metric exceeds threshold?
  ├── No  → Continue normally (session resumes next time)
  └── Yes → ContextRoller triggers:
            1. Reconstruct transcript from messages table
            2. Call session-summarizer (cheap model, ~30s)
            3. Store summary as memory item (type: 'summary')
            4. Clear session → next run starts fresh
                               ↓
            ContextAssembler injects into fresh session:
            ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │ ## Prior-conversation state (read-only)             │
            │ [Latest session summary / recent observations,      │
            │  bounded by a char budget]                          │
            │ ### Recent Messages                                 │
            │ [Turns AFTER the most recent rotation, up to        │
            │  recentMessageCount, tagged as                      │
            │  "[previous turn, user]: ..."]                      │
            └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **80K threshold** — leaves headroom for current turn I/O (~10-20K) within Sonnet's 200K window. Fresh sessions start at ~10-15K, giving ~70K of organic conversation before the next rotation.
- **Summaries are memory items** — stored as `memory_items` with type `summary`, so they're subject to `memory-groomer` consolidation. Old summaries get merged/pruned automatically.
- **Daemon-side, not agent-side** — the agent never knows its session was rotated. Context injection happens in the system prompt before the agent sees its first message.
- **Awaited, not fire-and-forget** — rotation completes before the next queue item is processed, preventing race conditions.
- **Prompt injection mitigation** — injected historical content is framed as "prior-conversation state" and replayed turns use bracketed state tags (`[previous turn, user]: …`) rather than `User:` / `Assistant:` role markers, so the main agent doesn't mistake historical context for live instructions. Recent Messages is scoped to turns AFTER the most recent rotation via `metadata.rotatedThroughTs`; pre-rotation turns are already compressed in the summary/observation.
- **Bounded observation replay** — for the observational-memory path, the ContextAssembler replays observations up to a character budget (~20K) rather than concatenating the full log. This keeps prompt size flat over the thread's lifetime while preserving the newest state snapshot plus recent consolidated history.
- **Durable completion state** — each observation persists `taskComplete` in metadata. When the observer flags the prior turn as complete, the assembler suppresses "Current task:" / "Next step:" hints so stale task pointers don't survive rotation and cause the agent to re-enter old work.

**Files:** `src/daemon/context-roller.ts`, `src/daemon/context-assembler.ts`

#### Observational memory (long-term context)

The default `session-summarizer` produces a single summary blob that gets overwritten on each rotation — history beyond the last rotation is lost. For long-running conversations (e.g. Telegram threads spanning days), switch to **observational memory** by setting `summarizer: session-observer`.

Instead of overwriting, observations **append** over time as a dated, prioritized decision log:

```
Date: 2026-04-07
- 🔴 14:10 User wants to replace openai-compatible provider with Mastra Harness
- 🔴 14:12 Decision: keep existing provider, add new mastra-code provider alongside
- 🟡 14:15 LibSQL storage uses separate mastra.db to avoid WAL contention
- 🟢 14:20 Background invocations not supported yet

Date: 2026-04-07
- 🔴 16:30 Implemented observational memory for context roller
- 🟡 16:45 Reflector threshold set at 40K chars
```

When the observation log exceeds 40K characters, the `session-reflector` sub-agent consolidates — merging related observations, dropping superseded context, and preserving important decisions. This gives the agent long-term memory that survives many rotations. The reflector carries `taskComplete`, `currentTask`, `suggestedContinuation`, and the rotation-snapshot timestamp forward onto the consolidated row.

Each observation also carries `taskComplete`, `currentTask`, and `suggestedContinuation` metadata. When `taskComplete` is true, hints are neither persisted nor surfaced — so the agent resumes only when there is genuinely unfinished work, and stale task pointers don't drift across rotations.

**Priority levels:** 🔴 high (critical decisions, goals, deadlines) · 🟡 medium (questions, preferences, conditional info) · 🟢 low (ephemeral context, minor details)

```yaml
# 1. Set the provider's summarizer to session-observer
contextManagement:
  enabled: true
  triggerMetric: input_tokens
  thresholdRatio: 0.75
  recentMessageCount: 10
  summarizer: session-observer # enables observational memory
  reflectionThresholdChars: 40000 # observation-log size that triggers session-reflector (default 40000)

# 2. Add the observer and reflector to the persona's subagents list
personas:
  - name: assistant
    subagents:
      - session-observer # required for observational memory
      - session-reflector # required for observation consolidation
      - memory-groomer
      - memory-retriever
      - file-searcher
```

**Important:** Personas only load sub-agents explicitly listed in their `subagents` config. Without `session-observer` and `session-reflector` in the list, the context-roller won't find them at runtime. You can remove `session-summarizer` from personas using OM since it won't be called.

For multi-step agent providers that expose both cumulative and final-step usage, Talon keeps cumulative usage for accounting and Langfuse, but gates context rotation on the final model step. Codex CLI provides this through its `token_count.last_token_usage` events; this prevents tool-heavy turns from rotating simply because cumulative billed input crossed the threshold.

### Provider Support

Sub-agents can use any supported AI provider. Configure API keys in `talond.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    anthropic:
      apiKey: ${SUBAGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    openai:
      apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    google:
      apiKey: ${GOOGLE_API_KEY}
    ollama:
      baseURL: http://localhost:11434/v1
      # apiKey: ${OLLAMA_API_KEY}   # required for Ollama Cloud / authenticated endpoints
```

The `ollama` slot is Talon's OpenAI-compatible passthrough — use it for local Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama Cloud, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `apiKey` is forwarded when set (required for authenticated endpoints) and falls back to a dummy value for local endpoints that either ignore auth or accept any token. Environment variable references like `${OLLAMA_API_KEY}` are substituted from the shell environment / `.env` file at config load.

### Persona Configuration

Personas must declare which sub-agents they can invoke and have the `subagent.invoke:*` capability:

```yaml
personas:
  - name: assistant
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    subagents:
      - session-summarizer
      - memory-groomer
      - memory-retriever
      - file-searcher
    capabilities:
      allow:
        - subagent.invoke:*
        - memory.access:*
        - fs.read:*
```

The agent also needs to know about its sub-agents in the system prompt. Add a section describing the available sub-agents and their input schemas so the agent knows when and how to use them.

### Testing Sub-Agents

Use `talonctl run-subagent` to test sub-agents without a running daemon:

```bash
# File search (no DB needed)
npx talonctl run-subagent --name file-searcher --input '{"query": "deployment"}'

# Session summarizer (no DB needed)
npx talonctl run-subagent --name session-summarizer --input '{"transcript": "User: hello\nAssistant: hi"}'

# memory-retriever and memory-groomer require a running daemon (they need DB access)
```

### Creating a Custom Sub-Agent

1. Create a directory under `subagents/` (in cwd or dataDir) with a `subagent.yaml` manifest
2. Write an `index.ts` (dev) or `index.js` (production) with an exported `run(ctx, input)` function returning `Result<SubAgentResult, SubAgentError>`
3. Add prompt fragments in `prompts/` (numbered for ordering: `01-system.md`, `02-examples.md`)
4. Declare required capabilities in the manifest — the daemon validates these against the persona at invocation time
5. Optionally add `requiresEnv` to the manifest — the loader skips the sub-agent if any listed env vars are missing (useful for provider-specific API keys)
6. Test with `talonctl run-subagent --name your-agent --input '{}'`

Custom sub-agents override built-in ones if they share the same name (dataDir takes precedence over cwd, which takes precedence over built-in).

Foreground conversations are sticky by default: once a thread has run on one provider, Talon keeps using that provider for subsequent messages on the same thread. This preserves session continuity for resumable providers like Claude Code and Codex CLI. Resumable sessions are restored only for the same provider, model, and configured `reasoningEffort`; changing the configured model or effort starts a fresh provider session so Talon can inject the compressed session-observer/session-summarizer context. `reset-provider-affinity` does not rewrite run history — it stores a reset marker on the thread, which also prevents older persisted sessions from being restored after the reset.

The `external-id` value is connector-specific:

- Telegram: the `chat_id`
- Slack: `<channelId>:<thread_ts>` or just `<channelId>`
- Terminal: the `clientId`
- WhatsApp Business: the sender `wa_id`
- Email: `<address>:<messageId>`

```bash
npx talonctl list-threads --channel my-telegram
npx talonctl reset-provider-affinity --channel my-telegram --external-id 123456789
npx talonctl reset-provider-affinity --channel my-telegram --external-id 123456789 --yes
```

npx talonctl test-provider --name gemini-cli
```

For `openai-compatible` (**experimental**), use the canonical provider name `openai-compatible` or add an alias with `type: openai-compatible` when you need multiple endpoints at once. Credentials are looked up under `auth.providers.<options.providerId>.{apiKey,baseURL}` (e.g. `auth.providers.ollama`, `auth.providers.ollama-mac`, `auth.providers.groq`), so the same slot can be reused by the matching sub-agent provider. If no entry matches `providerId`, the provider falls back to `auth.providers.openai-compatible.{apiKey,baseURL}`. The provider streams text deltas, tool calls, and tool results via a Mastra-backed wrapper CLI, so users see incremental responses and tool activity in the connected channel (no "Thinking..." placeholder).

OpenAI-compatible entries may set a flat `options.providerOptions` record for vendor-specific request body knobs. Talon wraps it under `options.providerId` before calling Mastra, so disabling Qwen thinking on an `ollama-mac` alias is `providerOptions.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking: false`, not a nested `providerOptions.openai` block.

For endpoints that expose OpenAI-compatible `/v1/responses`, set `agentRunner.providers.<name>.options.apiMode: responses` to use the Responses API instead of the default Mastra chat-completions path. If the endpoint also supports stateful `previous_response_id` chaining, set `options.sessionMode: previous_response_id` (or pass `talonctl add-provider --api-mode responses --session-mode previous_response_id`). In this mode Talon stores the returned response id as the provider session id and resumes later turns with `previous_response_id`, so stateful oMLX-style endpoints can reuse their response-state chain and prefix/KV cache across tool-call steps. Stored response ids are scoped by provider, model, and configured reasoning effort; if you test a different model or effort on the same provider, Talon starts a fresh session and injects the assembled prior-conversation state instead of resuming the old chain. Use `sessionMode: previous_response_id` only for foreground agent-runner endpoints that implement stateful `/v1/responses`; leave it off for background providers, Ollama, vLLM, Groq, Together, and ordinary OpenAI-compatible chat-completions servers. The old `options.omlxResponses: true` and `talonctl add-provider --omlx-responses` forms are still accepted as deprecated aliases for `apiMode: responses` plus `sessionMode: previous_response_id`.

For OpenAI-compatible Responses requests, persona `reasoningEffort` is merged as `reasoning.effort` after provider options, so it wins over `options.providerOptions.reasoning.effort` while preserving other provider-level `reasoning` fields such as `summary`. In chat-completions mode, configuring `reasoningEffort` is rejected with a clear provider error because there is no deterministic cross-server chat-completions request shape for this field.

> **Experimental provider.** `openai-compatible` uses a Mastra-backed wrapper with several workarounds for Mastra/AI-SDK gaps: fetch-level `stream_options` injection for usage reporting, a high `maxSteps` safety net to avoid Mastra's low default tool-call limit, and workspace tool output caps to prevent stalls from large directory listings. These workarounds may break with future Mastra versions. If you encounter issues, pin your `@mastra/core` version and report the problem.

##### Prompt caching with `openai-compatible`

The provider already reads `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` from the upstream response (via Mastra / the AI SDK), maps it onto `cacheReadTokens` in the run's `AgentUsage`, and exposes all four cache metrics — `input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_total_input_tokens` — to the context roller and Langfuse observations. That means you can set `contextManagement.triggerMetric: cache_read_input_tokens` the same way as for `claude-code` or `codex-cli`, and prompt-cache hits will show up in the dashboard.

Whether you actually see non-zero cache counts depends entirely on the **upstream server**, not on Talon:

| Endpoint                                                            | Emits cached token counts?                                                                                                                                     |

| **Stateful Responses API with `sessionMode: previous_response_id`** | ✅ yes when `/v1/responses` usage includes cached token details; even when usage omits them, `previous_response_id` still avoids Talon reinjecting prior turns |

If your upstream does not emit `prompt_tokens_details`, `cache_read_input_tokens` will stay at 0 and `cache_creation_input_tokens` will equal `input_tokens` — that is the expected degradation, not a bug. Use `triggerMetric: input_tokens` for those endpoints.

### Doctor Checks

`talonctl doctor` runs 7 structured checks:

1. **OS compatibility** — Verifies Linux or macOS
2. **Node.js version** — Checks for Node 24+
3. **Docker availability** — Verifies Docker is installed and running
4. **Directory structure** — Ensures data directories exist
5. **Config file** — Validates `talond.yaml` syntax and schema
6. **Database migrations** — Checks for pending migrations
7. **Config validation** — Deep validation of personas, channels, and references

---

## Deployment

Talon supports three deployment modes.

### 1. Native Daemon (systemd)

The recommended mode for Linux servers. The daemon runs as a systemd service with automatic restart on failure.

```bash
# Install the service (detects user, directory, and node path)
sudo ./deploy/install-service.sh

# Or with explicit options
sudo ./deploy/install-service.sh --user talon --dir /home/talon/talon

# Start the daemon
sudo systemctl start talond

# Check status and follow logs
sudo systemctl status talond
journalctl -u talond -f

# The daemon will auto-start on boot and restart on crash
```

The install script generates a systemd unit from `deploy/talond.service` with your paths substituted. It reads environment variables from `.env` in the project root via `EnvironmentFile`.

If Codex subscription sub-agents are enabled, add `--codex-runner` to the
install command. It installs a root-owned systemd dependency that launches the
contained runner through Docker Compose before `talond`; the daemon itself is
never given Docker-socket access. Complete the runner's one-time dedicated
Codex login when the installer prints the command, then start `talond` as
normal. See [Codex runner deployment](#codex-runner-deployment).

The service includes security hardening: `NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectKernelTunables`, `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`, `RestrictAddressFamilies`, and more.

### 2. Containerized Daemon (Docker)

The zero-build path — a published multi-arch image plus a starter bundle
of config templates, a `talonctl` wrapper, and guided setup skills.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ivo-toby/talon/releases/latest/download/talon-starter.tar.gz | tar xz
cd talon-starter
./install.sh
cp .env.example .env                              # fill in secrets
cp config/talond.example.yaml config/talond.yaml  # edit for your setup
docker compose up -d
```

The image is published at `ghcr.io/ivo-toby/talond` (`:latest` and
per-release tags, linux/amd64 + linux/arm64). The bundle bind-mounts
`config/`, `personas/`, `data/`, and `userdata/` so you edit everything
from the host. The image includes GitHub CLI (`gh`); set optional `GH_TOKEN`
in `.env` for authenticated GitHub operations. The token is available to
processes launched by `talond`, so scope it to the repositories and permissions
needed. See [`starter/README.md`](starter/README.md) for the full walkthrough,
[`starter/docs/providers.md`](starter/docs/providers.md) for provider configuration, and
[`starter/docs/troubleshooting.md`](starter/docs/troubleshooting.md) when
something misbehaves.

To build the image yourself instead of pulling the published one:

```bash
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t talond .
```

### 3. Wake-Only Mode (Timer)

For low-traffic deployments. A systemd timer wakes the daemon periodically to process the queue, then exits.

```bash
sudo cp deploy/talond-wake.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/talond.timer /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable talond.timer
sudo systemctl start talond.timer
```

Default: wakes every 5 minutes. Adjust `OnUnitActiveSec` in `talond.timer`.

## Security Model

Talon applies capability-based access control to its host tools and records
side effects in its audit log. That limits what Talon exposes through its MCP
bridge; it does not sandbox a provider runtime or make an external model or
MCP server safe by itself. Docker container isolation for agent sandboxing is
planned as an additional layer.

### Host-Tools MCP Bridge

Agents interact with the host through a small set of MCP tools exposed over a Unix socket. The daemon mediates all side effects — agents cannot access channels, databases, or the network directly.

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schedule_manage`     | CRUD + list scheduled tasks (supports `promptFile` for reusable prompts) |
| `channel_send`        | Send messages to channel connectors (supports `externalChatId` for explicit targeting; CLI-created schedules must pass it or use `channel_list` / `channel_broadcast`) |
| `channel_list`        | List channels bound to the persona + their chat external_ids (discovery for `channel_send`) |
| `channel_broadcast`   | Fan out a message to every chat the persona is bound to; skips channel-default bindings (no `thread_id`) with a warning |
| `persona_send`        | Submit a delegated A2A task to another persona                           |
| `persona_task_status` | Fetch the status or result of a delegated A2A task                       |
| `persona_list`        | List personas available for delegation                                   |
| `memory_access`       | Read/write per-thread memory                                             |
| `net_http`            | Fetch external URLs                                                      |
| `db_query`            | Read-only database queries                                               |
| `subagent_invoke`     | Invoke a sub-agent by name                                               |
| `background_agent`    | Launch and manage long-running background workers                        |
| `execution_env`       | Create, exec, upload, download, checkpoint, and restore Sprite VMs       |

### Capability System

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Provider Runtime (host process)"
        Agent["Agent calls MCP tool"]
    end

    subgraph "talond (policy enforcement)"
        PR[Policy Engine]
        CR[Capability Resolver]
        EX[Execute Tool]
        AU[Audit Log]
    end

    Agent --> PR
    PR --> CR
    CR -->|not configured| R[Reject + log]
    CR -->|configured| EX
    EX --> AU
    R --> AU
```

Every MCP tool call goes through:

1. **Policy Engine** — Validates the tool exists and maps to a capability label
2. **Capability Resolver** — Checks the persona's configured capability labels
3. **Audit Log** — Records the decision and result regardless of outcome

### Database Query Isolation

Agents can query the database via the `db.query` tool, but are constrained by five independent security layers:

| Layer                     | Mechanism                                                                   | What it prevents                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Regex pre-check        | Rejects non-SELECT statements and forbidden keywords (INSERT, DROP, etc.)   | Write operations via SQL                                      |
| 2. Table whitelist        | Only 4 approved tables (`memory_items`, `schedules`, `messages`, `threads`) | Access to sensitive tables (personas, audit_log, queue_items) |
| 3. Thread/persona scoping | Auto-injects `WHERE thread_id = ? AND persona_id = ?` clauses               | Cross-tenant data leakage between personas or threads         |
| 4. Row limit              | Hard cap at 1,000 rows per query                                            | Resource exhaustion via large result sets                     |
| 5. Read-only connection   | Separate SQLite connection opened with `{ readonly: true }`                 | Any write operation, even if all other layers are bypassed    |

Complex SQL patterns (UNION, subqueries, CTEs, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) are rejected to prevent whitelist bypass via query composition. User-supplied WHERE conditions are wrapped in parentheses to prevent OR-based scoping escapes.

### Secrets Management

- Credentials use `${ENV_VAR}` references in `talond.yaml` and MCP `headers` / `env` fields — never hardcoded
- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file at startup
- `talonctl config-show` masks all secret values in output
- `talonctl env-check` audits config and MCP references without printing values

### `requireApproval` configuration

The schema supports a `requireApproval` capability list:

```yaml
capabilities:
  allow:
    - channel.send:telegram
    - memory.access
  requireApproval:
    - db.query:own
```

It is not an approval control today. The host-tool filter exposes tools listed
in `requireApproval` in the same way as tools listed in `allow`; bridge-level
approval enforcement is future work. Use the `allow` list to grant only the
capabilities you are prepared to expose, and keep high-risk integrations out
of a persona until their policy is implemented and verified.

---

## Durable Queue

The message queue is the backbone of Talon's resilience. Every inbound message is persisted to SQLite before processing begins.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: enqueue
    Pending --> Claimed: dequeue
    Claimed --> Processing: handler starts
    Processing --> Completed: success
    Processing --> Pending: transient error<br/>(retry with backoff)
    Processing --> DeadLetter: max attempts<br/>exceeded
    DeadLetter --> [*]: manual review
    Completed --> [*]
```

- **Crash recovery**: On restart, in-flight items (status `claimed` or `processing`) are reset to `pending`
- **FIFO per thread**: Messages within a thread are processed in order, no interleaving
- **Cross-thread parallelism**: Different threads process concurrently up to `max_concurrent_containers`
- **Exponential backoff**: Failed items retry with configurable base delay (1s), max delay (60s), and jitter
- **Dead-letter queue**: After max attempts (default 3), items move to dead-letter for manual review

---

## Memory System

Each conversation thread gets a persistent workspace:

```
data/threads/<thread_id>/
  memory/          # human-editable notes (CLAUDE.md, etc.)
  attachments/     # ingested inbound files
  artifacts/       # agent output files
  ipc/
    input/         # host -> container messages
    output/        # container -> host messages
    errors/        # failed IPC messages

### Memory Layers

| Layer             | Storage                | Purpose                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Transcript        | `messages` table       | Canonical message log, never rewritten          |
| Working memory    | In-prompt context      | Recent message window included in agent prompts |
| Thread notebook   | Filesystem (`memory/`) | Human-editable per-thread notes                 |
| Structured memory | `memory_items` table   | Extracted facts and summaries                   |

Memory writes are gated by persona capabilities. Thread notebooks persist across container restarts.

## Scheduling

Schedules are managed by agents at runtime via the `schedule_manage` MCP tool — agents can create, update, delete, and list their own scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks flow through the same queue and routing system as regular messages.

```yaml
# Config only sets the tick interval — schedules are agent-managed
scheduler:
  tickIntervalMs: 5000
```

Agents create schedules like:

```
"Schedule a daily briefing at 8am: cron 0 8 * * *"
"Check system health every 30 minutes"
```

| Schedule Type | Example     | Behavior                     |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cron          | `0 9 * * *` | Fires at 09:00 daily         |
| Interval      | `30m`       | Recurring at fixed intervals |
| One-shot      | (future)    | Single execution at set time |

Scheduled tasks are enqueued through the standard queue pipeline, subject to the same retry and dead-letter policies as regular messages. Cron expressions evaluate in system local time.

### Dedicated Execution Threads

Schedules created by the agent via `schedule_manage` are stored against a dedicated execution thread keyed by `(persona, channel, origin chat)` — not the live chat thread. This keeps scheduled runs from polluting the live conversation's session state.

Scheduled executions are intentionally short-context, one-shot runs. They do not use thread provider affinity, do not restore or persist provider session IDs, do not inject prior schedule-thread transcript through the context assembler, do not run context rotation / observational-memory compression, and do not persist skipped final assistant wrap-up text as outbound messages. A scheduled task only reaches the user when the agent explicitly calls `channel_send`; successful `channel_send` deliveries are persisted as outbound messages on the live recipient thread so follow-up replies include the scheduled message in conversation context.

The dedicated thread records the origin chat's `external_id` in metadata (`kind: "schedule"`, `originExternalId: "<chat id>"`). Outbound delivery (`channel_send`, typing indicators) reads that field and routes messages back to the originating chat, so users still receive scheduled notifications on the channel they set the schedule up from.

Scheduled tasks created from the CLI (`talonctl add-schedule`) have no `originExternalId` in their schedule-thread metadata, so `channel_send` cannot infer a recipient chat — the tool errors and points at the discovery/broadcast tools. Use `channel_list` to discover available chats, then `channel_send` with an explicit `externalChatId`, or use `channel_broadcast` to fan out to every chat the persona is bound to. Broadcasts skip channel-default bindings (those with `thread_id IS NULL`) with a warning in the `{ delivered, skipped, failed }` result summary.

List / update / cancel / delete remain persona-scoped rather than thread-scoped, so schedules created from the live chat are still fully visible and editable from the live chat thread.

### Task Prompt Files

Schedules can reference reusable prompt files stored in a persona's `prompts/` directory instead of embedding prompt text inline. This keeps long or complex prompts version-controlled and editable without touching the schedule itself.

```
personas/
  assistant/
    system.md
    personality/
      01-tone.md
    prompts/               # task prompt files
      morning-briefing.md
      weekly-review.md
```

When creating a schedule, use `promptFile` (the filename without `.md`) instead of `prompt`:

```
"Create a schedule at 8am weekdays using the morning-briefing prompt file"
```

The tool call uses `promptFile` in place of `prompt` — they are mutually exclusive:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "cronExpr": "0 8 * * 1-5",
  "label": "Morning briefing",
  "promptFile": "morning-briefing"
}
```

Prompt files are read on demand when the schedule fires, so edits to the file take effect on the next execution without restarting the daemon. The `talonctl add-persona` command scaffolds an empty `prompts/` directory alongside the `personality/` folder.

## Execution Environments (Sprites)

Background agents can run their work inside isolated [Sprites.dev](https://sprites.dev) Firecracker VMs instead of on the host filesystem. A sandboxed agent gets a dedicated VM where it can install packages, build code, run tests, and start servers — without touching the host.

### Why sandboxed execution

Running agent work directly on the host has risks: a coding agent could accidentally delete files, install conflicting dependencies, or leave orphaned processes. Sprites VMs give each task a clean, isolated environment that is destroyed when the task completes.

Concrete use cases:

- **Code review with live testing** — the agent clones a PR branch into a Sprite, runs the test suite, and reports results without polluting the host with dependencies or build artifacts
- **Dependency upgrades** — the agent installs updated packages inside a Sprite, runs the full build and test pipeline, and only downloads the updated lockfile if everything passes
- **Multi-variant experiments** — checkpoint a Sprite after initial setup, then restore repeatedly to test different approaches from the same baseline
- **Host-isolated build/test runs** — run builds, tests, and setup in a VM that does not get direct host filesystem access; use additional egress controls if you need network isolation guarantees

### How it works

When a foreground agent spawns a background worker with `sandbox=true`:

1. Talon provisions a Sprite VM via the Sprites.dev API
2. If `workingDirectory` is provided, Talon uploads that directory into the VM
3. The background worker runs with a per-task control directory as its `cwd` (not the host repo)
4. The worker uses the `execution_env` tool to run commands, transfer files, and manage checkpoints inside the VM
5. When the task completes (or fails, times out, or is cancelled), Talon destroys the VM automatically

### Configuration

Enable Sprites in `talond.yaml`:

```yaml
sprites:
  enabled: true
  token: ${SPRITES_TOKEN}
  workingDirectory: /workspace
  createTimeoutMs: 60000
  execTimeoutMs: 1200000 # 20 minutes
  autoDestroyOnCompletion: true
  resourceLimits:
    cpus: 2
    memoryMb: 4096
    diskGb: 20
```

### Persona setup

The persona that spawns sandboxed background agents needs both `subagent.background` and `execution.env` capabilities. You can also set per-persona defaults for sandbox behavior:

```yaml
personas:
  - name: software-engineer
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    capabilities:
      allow:
        - subagent.background
        - execution.env
        - channel.send:telegram
    executionEnv:
      sandboxDefault: true # sandbox=true unless overridden
      workingDirectory: /workspace
      resourceLimits:
        cpus: 4
        memoryMb: 8192
```

| Persona option                  | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `executionEnv.sandboxDefault`   | When `true`, `background_agent spawn` defaults to sandboxed                       |
| `executionEnv.baseSnapshot`     | Reserved for future snapshot-based creation; currently unsupported by the runtime |
| `executionEnv.workingDirectory` | Override the VM working directory                                                 |
| `executionEnv.resourceLimits`   | Override CPU, memory, and disk limits                                             |

### The `execution_env` tool

Foreground agents and background workers spawned with `sandbox=true` interact with Sprite VMs through the `execution_env` host tool. Available actions:

| Action       | Purpose                                                     | Required args                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `create`     | Provision a new VM (usually handled automatically on spawn) | —                                        |
| `exec`       | Run a command inside the VM                                 | `envId`, `command`                       |
| `upload`     | Copy files from the host into the VM                        | `envId`, `sourcePath`, `destinationPath` |
| `download`   | Copy files from the VM back to the host                     | `envId`, `sourcePath`, `destinationPath` |
| `checkpoint` | Snapshot the current VM state                               | `envId`                                  |
| `restore`    | Roll the VM back to a previous checkpoint                   | `envId`, `checkpointId`                  |
| `destroy`    | Tear down the VM                                            | `envId`                                  |

Host file transfers are restricted to Talon's allowed host roots. For foreground agents, that is the thread workspace. For background agents, that is the requested `workingDirectory`, plus the per-task control directory when sandboxed. Directory uploads require `recursive: true`; downloads are file-only.

### Checkpoint and restore

Checkpoints let agents save and restore VM state. This is useful for iterative workflows where the agent wants to try something, check the result, and roll back if it didn't work:

```
1. Agent sets up the environment (install deps, build)
2. Agent calls checkpoint → gets checkpoint ID
3. Agent runs tests with configuration A
4. Tests fail → agent calls restore with the checkpoint ID
5. Agent tries configuration B from the same clean baseline
```

Restore is in-place: it resets the existing VM to the checkpoint state rather than creating a new VM. The original `envId` stays valid.

### Lifecycle and cleanup

Talon destroys the primary Sprite VM on every terminal path:

- Normal task completion
- Task failure or timeout
- Explicit cancellation
- Daemon shutdown
- Orphan recovery on daemon restart

If `autoDestroyOnCompletion` is `false`, the VM persists after task completion and must be destroyed manually via the `execution_env destroy` action.

## MCP Integration

Talon supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
for connecting external tool servers to personas through skills. Add a server
to a skill that is attached to the persona:

```bash
# Local stdio server
npx talonctl add-mcp --skill web-search --name filesystem \
  --transport stdio --command npx --args -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /userdata

# Remote HTTP server with OAuth
npx talonctl add-mcp --skill work-search --name glean --transport http \
  --url https://search.example.com/mcp --auth oauth2
npx talonctl auth-mcp work-search:glean
```

For static tokens, use `${ENV_VAR}` in HTTP headers or stdio `--env` values,
and put the real value in `.env`. Do not place credentials literally in the
skill's MCP JSON file. The Docker starter uses
`talonctl auth-mcp <skill>:<server> --docker`; see
[HTTP MCP Servers and OAuth](#http-mcp-servers-and-oauth) for client setup,
refresh, and callback details.

MCP servers are passed through to the provider runtime at execution time. Each
persona receives only the servers supplied by its configured skills.

### Per-server MCP request timeout and tool-output cap

Each MCP server can carry two optional numeric keys in its skill JSON
(`skills/<skill>/mcp/<server>.json`), and `talonctl add-mcp` accepts them as
flags. Both values are Talon runtime metadata: only the Mastra /
OpenAI-compatible provider path (both chat-completions and Responses API
modes) forwards them to the wrapper; native Claude, Gemini, and Codex CLI
runs omit this metadata, so these limits have no effect on those providers.

```bash
npx talonctl add-mcp --skill work-search --name glean --transport http \
  --url https://search.example.com/mcp --auth oauth2 \
  --timeout-ms 180000 --tool-output-cap 12000
```

- `timeoutMs` — per-MCP-request timeout in milliseconds (integer ≥ 1000).
  When omitted, Mastra's 60 000 ms default applies. This is Talon runtime
  metadata only — it is never sent to the MCP server as a header or auth
  value. The outer query timeout (`queryTimeoutMinutes`) still wins; the
  per-server timeout only bounds individual `listTools` / `callTool`
  operations.
- `toolOutputCap` — per-server cap, in characters, on a stringified MCP
  tool result before it enters the agent's message history (integer ≥ 0).
  `0` disables excerpting **for that MCP server only**. When omitted, the
  provider-level `toolOutputCap` (see `config/talond.example.yaml`) or the
  4 000-char provider default applies. Precedence: explicit per-server
  value > provider-level fallback > 4 000. Setting the provider-level
  `toolOutputCap` to `0` disables only that fallback — an explicit positive
  per-server cap still applies.

These caps bound MCP model-history injection, not network response bytes or
a full-output memory limit. When any effective MCP cap is positive, MCP tool
results (including those from servers capped at `0`) are stored in a
shared, run-local in-memory store for the current run; the model can
retrieve up to 8 000 content characters at a time (additional framing
apart) via the built-in `fetch_tool_output` tool. If all effective MCP caps
are `0`, no wrapper or recovery is injected and `fetch_tool_output` is
unavailable for MCP results. The built-in workspace file/shell tools and
their behavior are unchanged. Note: if a discovered MCP tool already owns
the reserved `fetch_tool_output` name, Talon does not overwrite it; the
run-local recovery is skipped for that run (delegating to the MCP tool,
with a warning logged).

### Existing Glean installs

The repository's Glean skill definition (`skills/glean/mcp/glean.json`)
carries `timeoutMs: 180000` and `toolOutputCap: 12000` under `config`. That
file is git-ignored and local-only: the Docker image does not package
`skills/` (it bind-mounts `/skills`), and neither starter bundle ships a
Glean skill. Rebuilding the image therefore does **not** update a Glean
JSON a user has already copied into their mounted or local `skills/` tree.

For an existing install, edit the two numeric keys in your actual Glean
skill MCP JSON (wherever it is mounted or copied, e.g.
`skills/glean/mcp/glean.json`): add or replace `"timeoutMs": 180000` and
`"toolOutputCap": 12000` **under `config`**, preserving all existing
`name`, `transport`, `url`, headers, env, and auth fields. Do not replace
the whole file, and do not re-run `add-mcp` on an existing name (duplicate
names are rejected). Example shape (generic URL):

```json
{
  "name": "glean",
  "config": {
    "name": "glean",
    "transport": "http",
    "url": "https://search.example.com/mcp",
    "timeoutMs": 180000,
    "toolOutputCap": 12000
  }
}
```

Because no release artifact or Docker image currently bundles this Glean
definition, any release claiming bundled Glean limit defaults is a release
blocker until packaging delivers the file.

## Token Usage Tracking

When using Anthropic API keys, Talon records token usage from Claude runtime results in the `runs` table:

- Input tokens, output tokens, cache read/write tokens per run
- `total_cost_usd` from Claude runtime results

Per-persona budget limits and a `talonctl usage` report command are planned (TASK-047).

---

## Observability with Langfuse

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM observability platform. When enabled, Talon exports structured traces for every agent run so you can inspect latency, token usage, tool calls, and model inputs/outputs from a single dashboard.

### Why it matters

Running autonomous agents across multiple channels means you lose visibility fast. Langfuse gives you:

- **Trace-level debugging** — See the full chain of events for any message: which persona handled it, what tools were called, what the model saw and produced
- **Cost tracking** — Token counts and cost breakdowns per trace when the provider reports them
- **Latency profiling** — Spot slow tool calls or bloated prompts before they become user-facing problems
- **Environment tagging** — Separate production, staging, and development traces cleanly

### How it works

Talon uses the `@langfuse/otel` span processor to emit OpenTelemetry spans directly to Langfuse. Each agent run creates a trace with nested spans for generations, tool invocations, and retriever calls. When Langfuse is disabled (the default), a noop service replaces it — no Langfuse libraries are initialized and no network calls are made. If initialization fails when enabled, Talon logs a warning and falls back to the noop service rather than crashing, so `enabled: true` does not guarantee traces will be exported.

### Setup

**1. Get Langfuse credentials**

Sign up at [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or deploy a [self-hosted instance](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host). Create a project and grab the public and secret keys.

**2. Set environment variables**

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
```

**3. Add the config block to `talond.yaml`**

```yaml
langfuse:
  enabled: true
  publicKey: ${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}
  secretKey: ${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}
  baseUrl: https://cloud.langfuse.com # or your self-hosted URL
  environment: production # tags traces by environment
  # release: v1.2.3                      # optional version tag
  # exportMode: batched                  # batched (default) or immediate
  # flushAt: 20                          # spans buffered before flush
  # flushIntervalSeconds: 5              # max seconds between flushes
```

All fields except `enabled`, `publicKey`, and `secretKey` have sensible defaults. If `enabled` is `false` (or the section is omitted entirely), no Langfuse dependencies are loaded and no network calls are made.

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # TypeScript -> dist/
```

### Test

```bash
npm test               # Run all tests
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage report (80% target)
```

The test suite includes:

- **Unit tests** — Every module, repository, connector, and CLI command
- **Integration tests** — IPC round-trips, queue durability, channel registry lifecycle
- **End-to-end tests** — Full message flow from inbound to outbound with real SQLite

### Lint and Format

```bash
npm run lint           # ESLint with TypeScript strict rules
npm run format         # Prettier
```

### Pull Request Validation

Pull requests run the `Verify PR` GitHub Actions workflow on Node.js 24. The
workflow installs dependencies with `npm ci`, then runs `npm run build` and
path-targeted Vitest checks selected from changed files by
`scripts/select-pr-tests.mjs`. It also runs `npm run lint` as an advisory step
until the existing lint baseline is clean enough to make blocking.

The workflow also runs on pushes to `main` and can be started manually from the
Actions tab. Manual runs can choose `test_scope=full` when a broad regression
pass is needed; PRs use `targeted` by default so small documentation, workflow,
or setup changes do not run the full Talon suite.

For daemon, channel, provider, queue, or execution-environment changes, pair the
PR workflow with the local Talon smoke harness documented in `AGENTS.md` or a
Sprite-based full validation run.

### Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev            # tsx watch mode with auto-reload
```

### Troubleshooting: `better-sqlite3` bindings error

If you see an error like:

```
Error: Could not locate the bindings file. Tried:
 → .../node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node
 ...
```

…the native module needs to be rebuilt for your current Node version. This
commonly happens after a Node upgrade or a fresh `npm install` where
`prebuild-install` reports success but does not produce a usable binary.

Rebuild from source:

```bash
npm run rebuild:sqlite
```

This runs `node-gyp rebuild --release` inside `node_modules/better-sqlite3`,
which is more reliable than `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.

## Data Model

Talon uses SQLite with WAL mode and foreign keys. All persistence goes through the repository pattern for future Postgres portability.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Talon's data model supports supervisor/worker patterns via `parent_run_id` in the `runs` table. Full multi-agent collaboration (provider runtime subagent/Task tool support) is planned in TASK-054.

---

## Agent-to-Agent Communication (A2A)

Talon implements [Google's A2A protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/) for internal persona-to-persona task routing. Any persona can delegate a task to another persona without human involvement, enabling supervisor/worker workflows and specialised delegation chains.

### How it works

Each persona is automatically discoverable as an A2A agent with a card describing its capabilities, skills, and endpoint. When persona A needs to delegate work to persona B, it submits a task via the internal A2A server. The task is persisted to the `a2a_tasks` table, enqueued as a `collaboration` queue item, and processed by the daemon exactly like any other message — but against the target persona's full model configuration.

For agent-facing delegation, Talon exposes three host tools behind the same capability family:

- `persona_send` submits a delegated task
- `persona_task_status` fetches the current status or final result later
- `persona_list` lists available target personas

All three are granted by the same capability label: `persona.send:*`. No separate capability is needed for task status lookups.

```
Persona A (source)
    │
    │  tasks/send  (JSON-RPC)
    ▼
A2A Server  ──►  a2a_tasks (submitted)
    │
    ▼
Collaboration Queue
    │
    ▼
AgentRunner  ──►  Persona B (target)
    │
    ▼
a2a_tasks (completed / failed)
```

### Task lifecycle states

| State            | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `submitted`      | Task accepted, enqueued for processing        |
| `working`        | AgentRunner has started processing            |
| `input-required` | Target persona is waiting for clarification   |
| `completed`      | Target persona finished and returned a result |
| `failed`         | Processing failed with an error code          |
| `canceled`       | Task was canceled before completion           |

### Agent-facing flow

The normal synchronous pattern is:

1. Call `persona_send` with `await_reply: true`
2. If the delegated task finishes quickly, the caller receives the final result directly
3. If the sync wait expires, the caller receives a structured timeout response with the `task_id`
4. The caller can then use `persona_task_status` to poll or wait for the final result without querying the raw database

`persona_send` now waits up to 5 minutes by default when `await_reply: true`. You can override that with `timeout_ms`. `persona_task_status` supports an optional `wait_ms` parameter for polling until the task reaches a terminal state.

Examples:

```json
{
  "target_persona": "work-context-manager",
  "message": "Fetch the latest Jira and Confluence updates",
  "await_reply": true,
  "timeout_ms": 300000
}
```

```json
{
  "task_id": "2b004602-b6ac-4dec-bd7b-f88e0565a16a",
  "wait_ms": 300000
}
```

### CLI commands

**List tasks:**

```bash
# List the 20 most recent A2A tasks
talonctl a2a list

# Filter by state and target persona
talonctl a2a list --status working --target software-engineer

# Show more results
talonctl a2a list --limit 50
```

**Send a task manually (for testing):**

```bash
# Submit a task to a persona and receive the task ID
talonctl a2a send software-engineer "Review the latest PR and summarise findings"

# Specify a source persona name (defaults to "cli")
talonctl a2a send software-engineer "Run the test suite" --source james
```

`a2a send` inserts a task directly into the database and enqueues it for processing. If the daemon is running, the task will be picked up immediately. If not, it will be processed on next daemon start.

### Configuration

A2A runtime limits live under the top-level `a2a:` block in `talond.yaml`. All
three keys are optional and fall back to the built-in defaults shown below:

```yaml
a2a:
  maxHops: 4 # max delegation chain depth (1..32)
  maxConcurrentPerTarget: 1 # max in-flight tasks per target persona (1..100)
  maxAttempts: 3 # max queue retries before dead-letter (1..20)
```

- **`maxHops`** — a task is rejected when its incoming `hopCount >= maxHops`.
  Raise this if your supervisor/worker chains genuinely need more depth.
- **`maxConcurrentPerTarget`** — admission control at submission time. Submissions
  beyond the cap fail with a "Max allowed" error. Raise this to allow parallel
  fan-out to the same persona.
- **`maxAttempts`** — retry budget for the `collaboration` queue items that
  carry A2A tasks. After this many failures the item is dead-lettered.

### Milestone 1 scope

The current implementation covers:

- Internal-only task routing (no external HTTP exposure)
- Single-hop and multi-hop delegation (configurable via `a2a.maxHops`, default 4)
- Concurrency admission per target persona (configurable via
  `a2a.maxConcurrentPerTarget`, default 1)
- Configurable queue retry budget (`a2a.maxAttempts`, default 3)
- Full task lifecycle tracking in `a2a_tasks` table
- Agent card discovery per persona
- CLI commands for listing and submitting tasks

### Coming in Milestone 2

- External A2A endpoint exposure (authenticated HTTP, for cross-instance routing)
- Per-task capability grants (fine-grained source/target permissions)
- A2A task monitoring dashboard
- Streaming task updates via SSE
